# labe-luxnos*

exploring the use of text adventures / interactive fiction for learning Ancient Greek

_* the name may change to labein-luxnos depending on whether we decide to use the imperative or infinitive_

## Background

Now see <https://github.com/jtauber/labe-luxnos/wiki/Background>.

## Roadmap

* continue my pre-existing work on vocabulary lists, especially arranging them semantically as that will be an important input to the story and setting design
* taking common formulaic syntactic constructions from classic text adventures and working out their equivalent in Greek
* sketching out ideas for basic setting (locations, objects, based on vocabulary lists)
* research existing engines / own implementation
* developing ideas for premise and story

Across all these, two key milestones come to mind:

* the simplest playable prototype that supports a handful of locations and a handful of objects you must interact with
* a fully playable demo with maybe an hour of gameplayâ€”potentially with the feeling its the start of a larger game
