exploring the use of text adventures / interactive fiction for learning Ancient Greek


## Background

I've been toying with the idea of games for language learning for a while (by which I don't mean the gamification of language learning—although I _am_ interested in that too—but rather playing actual games in a target langauge). In particular, I wondered whether certain communicative aspects of language learning could be achieved in adventure games where you're exploring a world and interacting with objects and potentially other people. The barrier was the exemplar I had in my mind was a modern virtual world with rich graphics and sandbox gameplay and there's simply no way I was ever going to achieve that as a little side project, although I did briefly discuss it with my regular sounding board for all things language learning: Seumas MacDonald.

At the vocabulary research colloquium at AAAL 2018 in Chicago, there was a talk on vocabulary acquisition through games versus television and movies and, even though the talk was about exactly the kind of game that would be impossible for me to do, an idea hit me like a lightning bolt as I sat in the sessions doing an old-style text adventure.
