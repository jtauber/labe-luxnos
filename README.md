# labe-luxnos*

exploring the use of text adventures / interactive fiction for learning Ancient Greek

_* the name may change to labein-luxnos depending on whether we decide to use the imperative or infinitive_

## Background

I've been toying with the idea of games for language learning for a while (by which I don't mean the gamification of language learning—although I _am_ interested in that too—but rather playing actual games in a target language). In particular, I've wondered whether certain communicative aspects of language learning could be achieved in adventure games where you're exploring a world and interacting with objects and potentially other (non-player) characters. The barrier was that the exemplar I had in my mind was a modern virtual world with rich graphics and sandbox gameplay and there's simply no way I was ever going to achieve that as a little side project, although I did briefly discuss it with my regular sounding board for all things language learning: Seumas MacDonald.

At the vocabulary research colloquium at AAAL 2018 in Chicago, there was a talk on vocabulary acquisition through games versus television and movies and, even though the talk was about exactly the kind of game that would be impossible for me to do, an idea hit me like a lightning bolt as I sat in the session: doing an old-school text adventure.

Text adventure games (also known as interactive fiction) are much easier to implement (technically—I'm not trying to take anything away from the skill of actually creating a compelling storyline and game). There are plenty of existing engines although it wouldn't be difficult to develop one's own (and the main attraction of that to me is some interesting vocabulary control). Because the entire interaction with the world is mediated through language (not clicking on pictures) it requires productive language use. Vocabulary is easy to control and the descriptive language can be as simple and formulaic or as rich as needed depending on the language level of the player. There's also an opportunity to do a bit of content-based learning as well, via the setting.

I'm going to explore this for Greek initially, but I'm interested in exploring it for other languages too, perhaps a Viking Adventure in Old Norse. I'm sure there would be plenty of people interested in Latin text adventures.

It is possible for people who don't know the target language to contribute to story design (understanding the constraints on language are greater than they might be used to). I definitely think the project lends itself to very old-school text adventure, not the broader range of interactive fiction one can find nowadays.

## Roadmap

* continue my pre-existing work on vocabulary lists, especially arranging them semantically as that will be an important input to the story and setting design
* taking common formulaic syntactic constructions from classic text adventures and working out their equivalent in Greek
* sketching out ideas for basic setting (locations, objects, based on vocabulary lists)
* research existing engines / own implementation
* developing ideas for premise and story

Across all these, two key milestones come to mind:

* the simplest playable prototype that supports a handful of locations and a handful of objects you must interact with
* a fully playable demo with maybe an hour of gameplay—potentially with the feeling its the start of a larger game
